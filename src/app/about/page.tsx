            I am Jesse, a passionate yogi and movement enthusiast. <br />
            From my early days of football, skating and eSports as a teenager to
            over 10 years as a professional breakdancer, movement has always
            been an integral part of my life. <br /> <br /> After initially
            discovering Yoga in 2015 and practicing on and off for a few years,
            it was during my transformative experience on the beaches of
            Fuerteventura in 2021 that I truly immersed myself in the profound
            connection between physical postures, meditation, and spirituality.
            This awakening ignited a deep passion within me and propelled my
            yoga journey into a new realm of exploration, expansion, and
            personal growth. <br />
            <br /> Seeking to deepen my understanding and learning about the
            history and mechanics of the transformative power of yoga, I
            embarked on a pilgrimage to India in April 2023, where I completed a
            rigorous 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training in the sacred city of
            Rishikesh. Since then, I have been dedicated to guiding others on
            their own transformative path, helping them discover the immense
            benefits of yoga beyond the physical aspects.
            <br />
            <br />
            In addition to my yoga journey, I have also pursued other fitness
            disciplines. In 2017 I completed a HIIT Instructor training for a
            new workout format that combines music with exercises and I have had
            the opportunity to work as a Freelance HIIT Instructor for various
            Gyms and companies in Berlin besides my main job. <br />
            <br /> Combining my passion for yoga and movement in general, I
            strive to offer a well-rounded approach to physical health and
            wellness, empowering individuals to cultivate strength, flexibility,
            mindfulness, and overall well-being. <br /> <br />

            I believe in the power of small group settings, as they foster a
            sense of connection and community. This belief inspired me to create
            9Friends, a space where we can come together, practice yoga, and
            support each other on our individual journeys of self-discovery and
            growth. <br />
            <br /> Join me on the mat as we cultivate strength, flexibility, and
            inner peace through mindfulness, movement, breathwork, and
            meditation. <br />
