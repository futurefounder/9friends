            I am Jesse, a passionate yogi and movement enthusiast. <br />
            From my early days of football and `&quot;aggressive`&quot; inline
            skating as a teenager to over 10 years as a professional
            breakdancer, movement has always been an integral part of my life.{" "}
            <br /> <br /> I discovered Yoga for myself in 2015, but it was in
            during transformative yoga classes on a beach in Fuerteventura in
            2021 that I discovered the profound connection between physical
            postures, meditation, and spirituality. Since then, my yoga journey
            has unfolded into a deep and diverse exploration, extending beyond
            the physical benefits I initially sought. <br /> <br /> Seeking
            further knowledge, I delved into yoga philosophy and embarked on a
            transformative trip to India, where I completed a 200-hour Yoga
            Teacher Training in Rishikesh. <br />

            <br />
            I believe in the power of small group settings, as they foster a
            sense of connection and community. This belief inspired me to create
            9Friends, a space where we can come together, practice yoga, and
            support each other on our individual journeys of self-discovery and
            growth. <br />
            <br /> Join me on the mat as we cultivate strength, flexibility, and
            inner peace through mindfulness, movement, breathwork, and
            meditation. <br />
            <br /> Let&apos;s embark on a yogic journey together, creating a
            space where mind, body, and spirit can harmoniously unite! <br />
