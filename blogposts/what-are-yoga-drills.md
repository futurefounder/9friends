## Yoga Drills: Exploring the Playful Path to Advanced Postures

Namaste, fellow yogis and yoginis! Welcome to our little corner of the internet, where we embrace the journey of yoga with joy and lightness of heart. Here, we understand that yoga isn't just about nailing those perfect physical postures; it's about the beautiful exploration of self and body.

However, there are times when the body craves a bit of adventure, yearning to explore those intermediate and advanced poses, and that's where yoga drills come into play!

## How Can Yoga Drills Help Your Yoga Practice?

So, you've been practicing yoga diligently, flowing through your vinyasas with grace, but the elusive Handstand (Adho Mukha Vrksasana) or the playful Crow Pose (Bakasana) seem like a distant dream? Fret not, for you are not alone in this journey. Learning advanced postures can be quite challenging with just regular yoga practice. That's where yoga drills step in to save the day!

Yoga drills are inspired by techniques used in various sports to improve skills and performance. These targeted exercises focus on strengthening specific muscles and developing the balance and flexibility required for those advanced poses. By incorporating yoga drills into your practice, you can create a strong foundation to work towards mastering those more challenging postures.

## 2 Examples Of Yoga Drills

### 1. Handstand Prep Drill: Wall-Assisted Balance (Duration: 5 minutes)

This drill is fantastic for building confidence and stability for your Handstand journey. It's suited towards intermediate practitioners, but can also be adapted to beginners.
Stand facing a wall, about an arm's distance away, and place your hands on the floor shoulder-width apart. Kick one leg up towards the wall, gently pressing the other foot against the wall for support. Engage your core and play with your balance, lifting both legs off the ground if comfortable. Use the wall to find alignment and work on finding your center of gravity. Hold for a few breaths and repeat on the other side. If possible, have a partner watch and correct your posture!

### 2. Crow Pose Activation: Frog Crunches (Duration: 7 minutes)

Get ready to channel your inner crow! Start laying on your back and slightly bending your knees outwards, while your feet are touching. Take your hands to your ears and get ready for a crunch. Lift your upper body, activating your core, while lifting your knees towards your elbows at the same time. Go down slowly and repeat!
